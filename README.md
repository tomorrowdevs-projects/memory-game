# Memory Game

### Requirements
- Cards needs to be shuffled on load or restart
- Game should know how to handle matched and unmatched cards
- Game should display the current number of moves a user has made
- The game should show a star rating (from 1–3) that reflects the player’s performance based on the number of moves made.
- When a player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
- A restart button should allow the player reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
- A congratulations modal should appear when the player wins while showing a button to play again and modal should show: How much time it took, and star rating.


## Rules and Usage
1. Initialize this project with `npm` running `npm init`
2. Install and configure `Jest` as a testing library
3. To run the tests, run `npm run test`
4. Write the code following the **TDD** (Test Driven Development) approach

## The Three Rules of TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

Which means the workflow is:

1. Write a failing test. Stop writing the test as soon as it fails.
2. Write the minimal production code required for the test to pass. Stop writing any code once the test passes.
3. Refactor the test code and the production code without altering the functionality. All tests should pass.




Before starting any of the tasks in this Learning Path, please READ the following rules
===============================

What do you need to start this Learning Path:
----------------
1. A GitHub account
3. A Local IDE or Editor
5. Git Environment
6. A http://toggl.com/ account and Chrome Extension
7. A Netlify account

Rules that you MUST follow:
----------------
- **Fork this repo into your own Github Account** as a **public** Repository
- **Create a Github Project** connected to the repository
- Read **carefully** the task description
- Analyze the task, and **create relative subtasks** to track any requirement and knowledge needed
- **Assign an estimate to each created subtask**
- Define a **deadline for the main task**
- **Provide a Flowchart within the project**
- Where required, involve other members of the community to support you on the development
- When working on a task, move it to the **In progress** column and start tracking it
- After each task completion, **move it to the "Done" column** and stop tracking it
- After the main task completion, share the solution (e.g. your GitHub repo) over the community
